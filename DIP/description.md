### Equivalents
* The `"Application"` class in the diagram is equivalent to the `"ChartApplication"` class in the code.

* The `"ServiceFactory"` interface in the diagram is equivalent to the `"IndicatorServiceFactory"` interface in the code.

* The `"ServiceFactoryImpl"` class in the diagram is equivalent to the `"IndicatorServiceFactoryImplementation"` class in the code.

* The `"ConcreteImpl"` class in the diagram is equivalent to the `"MovingAverageConcreteImplementation"` and `"VWAPConcreteImplementation"` classes in the code.

* The `"Service"` interface in the diagram is equivalent to the `"IndicatorService"` interface in the code.

### EXPLAINING

From the book:
The `Application` uses the `ConcreteImpl` through the `Service` interface. However, the `Application` must somehow create instances of the `ConcreteImpl`. To achieve this without creating a source code dependency on the `ConcreteImpl`, the `Application` calls the `makeSvc` method of the `ServiceFactory` interface. This method is implemented by the `ServiceFactoryImpl` class, which derives from `ServiceFactory`. That implementation instantiates the `ConcreteImpl` and returns it as a `Service`.

Also:

Most systems will contain at least one such concrete componentâ€”often called
main because it contains the main function. In the case illustrated in Figure 11.1, the main function would instantiate the ServiceFactoryImpl and place that instance in a global variable of type ServiceFactory. The Application would then access the factory through that global variable.
